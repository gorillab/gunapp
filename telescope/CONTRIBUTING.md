Important: the Legacy version will not be supported going forward. All new development should happen on the main [Nova](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope/tree/master) version. 

Before starting on a new feature, please [check out the roadmap](https://trello.com/b/oLMMqjVL/telescope-roadmap) and come check-in in the [Telescope Slack channel](http://slack.telescopeapp.org/).

Also, all PRs should be made to the `legacy-devel` branch, not `legacy`.

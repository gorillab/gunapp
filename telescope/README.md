There are currently two discinct versions of Telescope: **Nova** and **Legacy**. 

**Nova** is the new, React-based version and all development will happen on this version going forward. It's used by the [master](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope/tree/master) and [devel](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope/tree/devel) branches. 

**Legacy** (this version) is the old, Blaze-powered version of Telescope and you can find it on the [legacy](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope/tree/legacy) and [legacy-devel](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope/tree/legacy-devel) branches. 

Note that both versions use the same data format, so you can go back and forth between them on the same app and the same database.

Telescope is an open-source, real-time social news site built with [Meteor](http://meteor.com)

**Note:** Telescope is beta software. Most of it should work but it's still a little unpolished and you'll probably find some bugs. Use at your own risk :)
